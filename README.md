### Lemonade Stand JavaScript Game

The purpose of this game is to quickly and efficiently earn money by carefully balancing only three elments: the price of lemonade cups, the amount of signs to market your lemonade stand and the price of each cup. While the source code for the original Lemonade Stand game was used as inspiration, the code for this game is original and developed to insert more randomness and unpredictability into the while maintaining the need for sound business, marketting and economic practices.

## How to Play
1. Observe the weather and finances. People are more likely to buy lemonade on hot and sunny days and not very likely to do so on rainy days. It is wise to adjust to your past sales results.
2. Set the number of cups signs and the price per cup for the next sales day using the three respective sliders.
3. Press the lemonade to simulate the day and evaluate the results for the day.
