  Lemonade Game by Carlos Velasco </div> # Lemonade ### Lemonade Stand JavaScript
  Game The purpose of this game is to quickly and efficiently earn money by
  carefully balancing only three elments: the price of lemonade cups, the amount
  of signs to market your lemonade stand and the price of each cup. While the
  source code for the original Lemonade Stand game was used as inspiration,
  the code for this game is original and developed to insert more randomness
  and unpredictability into the while maintaining the need for sound business,
  marketting and economic practices. ## How to Play 1. Observe the weather
  and finances. People are more likely to buy lemonade on hot and sunny days
  and not very likely to do so on rainy days. It is wise to adjust to your
  past sales results. 2. Set the number of cups signs and the price per cup
  for the next sales day using the three respective sliders. 3. Press the lemonade
  to simulate the day and evaluate the results for the day.
