    <h1>Lemonade by Carlos Velasco</h1>
    <h1>Lemonade Stand JavaScript Game</h1> The purpose of this game is to quickly
    and efficiently earn money by carefully balancing only three elments: the
    price of lemonade cups, the amount of signs to market your lemonade stand
    and the price of each cup. While the source code for the original Lemonade
    Stand game was used as inspiration, the code for this game is original
    and developed to insert more randomness and unpredictability into the while
    maintaining the need for sound business, marketting and economic practices.
    ## How to Play 1. Observe the weather and finances. People are more likely
    to buy lemonade on hot and sunny days and not very likely to do so on rainy
    days. It is wise to adjust to your past sales results. 2. Set the number
    of cups signs and the price per cup for the next sales day using the three
    respective sliders. 3. Press the lemonade to simulate the day and evaluate
    the results for the day. </div>
